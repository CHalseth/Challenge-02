                </h3>
                    <p>
                        Working as a warehouse employee my entire adult life has taught me there are more opportunities in the world than just moving freight for customers. You just have to work for those opportunities.

                        The official story: I am a dock worker for Estes Express Lines looking to change my career path. I have an associates degree in business management that took me too long to get due to the transitional schooling system, after high school, not being for me.
                        I have held multiple jobs in the warehousing industry including management postions. These jobs just haven't fulfilled my needs as an individual.
                        Working with computers has always been a hobby of mine. From fixing family and friends computer issues to building my own computer.
                        I have decided it is time to finally jump into a career path that allows for me to work with computers and make money doing it. This brought me to web development.
                        The problem solving and complexity of the tasks at hand scratch the itch that my brain never received from warehouse work.
